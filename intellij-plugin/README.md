# IntelliJ Plugin for the PRL (Pragmatic Rule Language)

This Plugin is work in progress. There will be bugs and some features of PRL (e.g. backticked identifiers) might not be supported in some cases.

You can install the plugin manually by going to Settings -> Plugins -> "Install plugin from Disk..." and selecting the file `PRL IntelliJ Plugin-0.0.1.zip` in the root directory of this project.

## Main Features

- Syntax highlighting, including custom color settings page
- Error highlighting (including running the PRL compiler in the background)
- Code completion
- Code formatting including some custom settings
- Go to definition of features, groups, and slicing properties
- Find and/or highlight usages of features, groups, and slicing properties
- Rename refactoring
- Quick fix for adding unresolved features
